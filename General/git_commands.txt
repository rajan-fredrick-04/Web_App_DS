When working on project the following commands must be used:
1. git add . - add all files to the repository
    -> Command - git add --all(To add all)/git add <file>/git add <directory>
2. git commit -m "message" - commit all files to the repository
    -> Command - git commit -m "message"
3. git push - push all files to the repository
    -> Command - git push -u origin main
4. git pull - pull all the files from the repository

Whenever you have done some changes and you are about to add the changes,
First you have to use git pull command and then this flow add->commit->push.
